# Default max_connections in the MariaDB 10.6.13 docker image is 151.
# DMâ€™s dump phase opens ~<threads> connections per source + a few extras (meta/status).
# Precheck `dumper_conn_number_checker` fails if this limit is too low.
# Rule of thumb: max_connections >= (sources * dump_threads) + 20. Setting 500 for headroom.
max_connections = 500
